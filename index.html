    <h1>Happy Valentine’s Day, Diana 🤍</h1>  
    
    <p>I know we haven’t talked much lately, but I wanted to reach out today with honesty and respect. I still care about you, and I truly appreciate the connection we shared. Those memories always bring a smile whenever I think of them.</p>

    <p>I wasn’t looking for you when you found me.</p>

    <p>Back then, love was the last thing on my mind. I had walls, plans, goals — and a hundred reasons not to let anyone get close.</p>

    <p>You didn’t try to break those walls down. You just stayed. You talked to me like I mattered even when I was distant. You made me feel appreciated when I didn’t even think I deserved that kind of attention.</p>

    <p>I thought you were just being kind. I didn’t realize you were slowly teaching my heart how to feel again.</p>

    <p>You were patient with me when I was unsure. Warm with me when I was cold. Constant… even when I gave you almost nothing back.</p>

    <p>And somewhere in between our conversations, your random stories, and the way you made space for me in your world… mine started making space for you too.</p>

    <p>I didn’t notice it at first. I was too busy pretending I wasn’t the type to fall. Too focused on convincing myself I didn’t need anyone.</p>

    <p>Until one day, it hit me quietly — I looked for you without meaning to. I missed you in moments you weren’t there. Your voice became my comfort without me realizing when that happened.</p>

    <p>That’s when I understood.</p>

    <p>While I was busy not trying to love anyone… I had already fallen for you. Deeply and slowly.</p>

    <p>And the most painful part?</p>

    <p>You cared for me when I wasn’t ready. But I fell for you when it might already be too late.</p>

    <p>I realized it at a time<br>
    when life isn’t ready for us.<br>
    When responsibilities, distance, timing —<br>
    all the things we can’t control —<br>
    stand in the space where i wish we could stand together.</p>

    <p>If I had met you in a different moment,<br>
    a different season of life,<br>
    maybe this feelings wouldn’t feel so heavy.</p>

    <p>Maybe I could hold your hand<br>
    instead of just holding these feelings inside my chest.</p>

    <p>And maybe in another time —<br>
    when life was less complicated,<br>
    when wounds weren’t still healing,<br>
    when we were both more ready —<br>
    this feelings could have been something we held onto together.</p>

    <p>We don't know what the future holds. So If I had one wish, I wouldn’t ask for stars or endless skies. I’d ask to find my way back home — to the place my heart still recognizes. But the timing isn’t right, so I carry this memory gently instead, like a light I’m not allowed to touch — only to remember how it once warmed me.</p>

    <p>And maybe, when the world finally softens its timing, home will open its door to me again. And if that happens, I’ll wait gladly, quietly, with patience in my heart.</p>

    <p>So take your time.<br>
    Heal.<br>
    Grow.<br>
    Reaching your goals.<br>
    Become the woman you want to be.</p>

    <p>I understand that when things started to grow between two people, life asked something different from both of them. So we keep walking forward — growing, learning, reaching goals, and living our lives. If the future can gives us another chance, it would be something really special and beautiful. But if life leads us in different directions, I’m still grateful, because knowing you inspired me to grow.</p>

    <p>Just know this…</p>

    <p>My heart isn’t open for just anyone.<br>
    It’s closed — carefully, intentionally.<br>
    The door may be locked.<br>
    But you're the only one who has the key.</p>

    <p>And if one day.......<br>
    you come back,<br>
    ready, whole, and certain…</p>

    <p>you won’t have to knock.</p>

    <p>I’ll be right here.</p>

    <p>But whatever your decision is, i respect, i understand. Wishing you happiness always.</p>

    <p>I hope you’re doing well, finding success in your work, and taking care of yourself. You deserve happiness, peace of mind, and people around you who support your dreams.</p>

    <p>Thank you for everything and thank you for your time, just to read this. I wish I could say it to you in person, but knowing myself, I can’t express these words vocally, so I write them instead ♥️</p>

    <p>– Archie</p>
